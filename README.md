# LiF_2D
Simulates how a LiF diffraction pattern would appear an a SHeM

To run simulation, run the LiF_full_2D script

On the left, the diffraction pattern will appear with a red circle indicating the position of the detector aperture with respect to the pattern. On the right, the obtained signal is plotted, with the total appearing in blue and the orange showing just the diffuse component.
