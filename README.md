# LiF_2D
Collection of code to support publication on observation of diffraction contrast from a SHeM. 
The simulation folder contains code to predict the signal obtained by diffraction contrast in a SHeM.
An additional readme can be found in that folder to explain how to run the code.

The comparison folder contains code to compare the z scan performed on a diffuse scattering surface to the solid angle of the detector
during the z scan
